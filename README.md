# Railway-Gateway-system
Implementation of a model using Verilog coding for railway gateway system.
## Objectives
- To implement the Railway gateway system using Verilog coding, understanding the rotation of the stepper motor, output and input pins.<br>
- Implementing the Verilog coding techniques learnt during the academic semester to gain a better understanding of the code flow and the peripherals.<br>
- Controlling the stepper motor according to the result action required by the gate.<br>
## Introduction
The project is all about creating a smart railway gate system using Verilog. We wanted to make railway crossings using the peripherals present on the Xilinx Spartan 3 board. So, we used the logic to control important parts like the gate motor and light indicators. The aim is to make the system understand commands from switches and show what's happening with lights, while moving the gate precisely. 
## Hardware Used
- Xilinx Spartan 3
- Stepper motor
- 2 LEDs
- Jumper wires
